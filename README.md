Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?


Throughout the development of the full-stack project, various front-end code types were employed in different sections of the application. The customer-facing site was initially crafted in Express HTML and later transitioned to a .hbs view to enhance rendering speeds by avoiding the necessity to fully load every component upon each refresh. While HTML is static and oriented toward clients, it lacks the capability to interact with backend databases for dynamic information updates. To address this limitation, JavaScript, a versatile language for both frontend and backend development, was utilized. It played a crucial role in introducing dynamic elements to the webpage, facilitating the retrieval of trip information from the MongoDB database. Consequently, the page could adapt dynamically based on user interactions. The implementation of a single-page application was a key design choice. In contrast to traditional HTML pages that refresh entirely with each user interaction, a single-page application minimizes these refreshes. This approach contributes significantly to providing the website with a local/native application feel, enhancing the user experience during interactions with the application itself.


How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.


JSON serves as a standardized format for organizing object data, facilitating its seamless interpretation by JavaScript into a literal JavaScript object. This simplifies the process of transforming data into a JavaScript object, thereby establishing a connection between frontend and backend development. By enabling the storage of data or JavaScript objects on the backend, JSON establishes a mechanism for utilization in various scenarios based on frontend requests. This approach not only streamlines the storage of data but also allows for its retrieval and utilization in diverse ways. A notable instance of code refactoring for enhanced functionality and efficiency lies in the differentiation between the trip card and trip list components. Maintaining two distinct components that render identical information proves inefficient. Instead, rendering each trip individually while ensuring it contributes to the overall functionality of the site proves to be more effective. The practice of reusing UI components carries several advantages. It reduces the overall size of an application, expedites the development process, and diminishes the likelihood of introducing errors and vulnerabilities into the system, assuming the component itself is secure.


Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.


Before implementing security measures, there are various ways to test endpoints. Initially, one can simply navigate to the localhost web address of the API endpoint, observing whether the page successfully loads data or detects errors in case of issues. An efficient approach involves utilizing applications like Postman, designed for testing HTTP requests. Postman not only facilitates endpoint testing but also incorporates security measures to assess protected endpoints against unauthorized access. In the context of a full-stack application, the website's methods govern the functionality and dynamics of the webpage. HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are instrumental in retrieving or modifying the database to implement desired functionality. On the backend, these methods correspond to database functions like .create, .findOne, .find, and .findOneAndUpdate, adapting the database based on client requirements. Endpoints, representing the outcomes of these methods as observed by administrators or client-side applications, must undergo testing to ensure they function correctly, displaying data as intended or signaling errors when applicable. The integration of security measures is an additional layer of code designed to prevent unauthorized or unauthenticated users from accessing or modifying the database. For instance, when adding or editing a trip in the database, these API endpoints require protection to safeguard against tampering by unauthorized users.


How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?


This course has been immensely beneficial for my professional development. Juggling full-time work and full-time school made it challenging to pinpoint my post-graduation path, including which programming languages intrigued me and whether I preferred front-end or back-end development. However, this course has played a pivotal role in clarifying my career direction and identifying additional skills I need to cultivate for competitiveness in the job market. A major skill I've acquired throughout this process is a profound understanding of how various modules or components of code interconnect and contribute to constructing a final product. This newfound comprehension has greatly enhanced my ability to navigate and manipulate code elements, ultimately contributing to my overall skill set.
